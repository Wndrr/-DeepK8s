# Deep K8s

## What is the woot ?

Pronounce "Deep Case" (diːp keɪs) is an overview, dashboard and administration tool for Kubernetes. It is currently in the indev stage, missing most of the features and polishing.

This project aims at being an alternative to the kubectl command line aswell as an helper project for its usage. Many of the operations normally executed through the kubectl CLI can be performed within the Deep K8s GUI but the executed commands are also available to copy/paste if need be.

## Documentation

There isn't any so far. But it'll come, rest assured, it'll come ... in time

## Motivation

The origin of this project is the absence of a similar software currently on the market with *all* of the following:

Feature-riche, beautiful UI, ergonomically optimized UI, fast response times, cross-platform and generally speaking an all-in-one solution for cluster management.

## Tech

The thinggy runs on [blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) server-side hosted in a [Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET)
