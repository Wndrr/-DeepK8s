# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Considering the project is in the heavy WIP stage, only the latest released version will receive support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you found or think you have found a vulnerability/security flaw in the software, email me directly at mathieu@viales.fr
You can expect a response within one or two days.

If you want to report a "normal" bug, that is a bug not related to security, or request a new feature, create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Wndrr/DeepK8s/issues).
You should get a response within 2 days.
